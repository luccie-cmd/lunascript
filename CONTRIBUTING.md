# Contributing

- I only look into small PRs that suggest
  - New frontends,
  - bug fixes,
  - documentation fixes.
- I do not look into PRs that
  - implement new features on the compiling/backend,
  - refactor/cleanup the code.
- What qualifies as a bug, a feature, or refactoring is entirely upon my interpretation.

Sorry for any inconveniences. If you want to stir the project in a particular direction in terms of features feel free to fork it, I don't mind. Just make sure you have fun while developing it! This is like the whole point!
